                    Welcome to this demo of
                    <a href="https://github.com/arpadroid/themes" target="_blank">Arpadroid Stylesheet Bundler</a>.<br />
                    Refer to the link above to access the source code and documentation on GitHub.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use this as a playground to experiment with the theme stylesheets and explore the
                    possibilities. I will demonstrate some handy use cases below. <br/>
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary><h2>Setting up</h2></summary>
                    <p>
                        <strong>To get the demo environment set up, you can follow these steps:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            If you have checked out the project from GitHub, you will need to run
                            <code>npm install</code> at the root of the project. If you have installed it through
                            NPM then you don't need to do this.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To get the bundler running in this demo you can go to the root of this project using the CLI and
                            run the command <code>npm run bundle:css:dev</code>.
                            <br />
                            This should be watching your files and recompiling them on change.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To get Livereload working also run the command <code>guard</code> from the root of
                            this project.
                            <br />
                            Make sure you have read the
                            <a href="https://github.com/arpadroid/themes" target="_blank">docs</a> and installed
                            the necessary dependencies. <br />
                            If done correctly, you should see the new styles instantly refresh in the browser when
                            you make a change and the state of your page will remain intact.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </details>

                    <p>
                        We have added a stylesheet in the head of this document for the dark theme. If you inspect
                        the source you will notice that the dark theme stylesheet is disabled by default. It has
                        an id of <code>dark-theme</code> and we can use JavaScript to toggle it on and off.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although we are using a custom element as the button and it is not immediately obvious
                        what's happening, all we are doing is toggling the disabled attribute on the stylesheet
                        link. This is a simple way to toggle the theme on and off.
                        <br />
                        Check it out:
                        <!-- <button-component class="button" type="button" label="Sample button" icon="&#10003;"/> -->
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <dark-theme-button />
                    </p>
                </details>
    
                <details>
                    <summary><h2>Toggling themes based on screen size</h2></summary>
    
                    <p>
                        If you find yourself battling with convoluted media queries and complex styles to switch between mobile and desktop, possibly because the styles in mobile happen to be very different to those of large screens, then you might find this approach useful.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        In the following way, we can toggle the desktop/mobile themes whenever appropriate.
                        <br/>
                        <blockquote>
                            &lt;link id="mobile-theme" rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 700px)" href="themes/mobile/mobile.bundled.css" /&gt;
                            <br/>
                            &lt;link id="desktop-theme" rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 701px)" href="themes/desktop/desktop.bundled.css" /&gt;
                        </blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a simple way to toggle the theme based on the screen size. You can see the
                        difference by resizing the browser window.
                    </p>
                    
                </details>
                <p>
                    <strong>Did you know?</strong> Toggling stylesheets off when not needed can help reduce the load on the browser and improve rendering performance in a considerable way.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>  
                    Last but not least... organizing your stylesheets in the way Arpadroid Themes allows to, helps reduce the complexity and cognitive load of working with large stylesheets, keeping your styles more organized and maintainable.
