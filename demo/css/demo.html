                            Arpadroid Themes is basically a stylesheet compiler. It leverages ability to
                            create multiple stylesheets, which are compiled from many different stylesheet
                            sources across your application.
                        </p>
                        <p>Getting started is easy:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    The theme styles will be kept under a directory within your application source
                                    code with a name and location of your own choosing. The name of this
                                    directory will represent the theme stylesheet name e.g 'default',
                                    'dark', 'light', etc...

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is required that you have a JSON theme configuration file in the root
                                    of this directory. The naming convention is '[directoryName].config.json'
                                    e.g 'default.config.json', 'dark.config.json', 'light.config.json', etc...
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The configuration file should define the theme stylesheets inside the
                                    includes array. The stylesheet includes are relative to the theme
                                    directory and the extension should be omitted. e.g.
                                    <pre>
                                        <code>

                                    It is possible to have theme stylesheets outside the theme directory, which are compiled back to the output theme stylesheet, by convention these stylesheets will have a sub-extension matching the theme name e.g. 'buttonComponent.dark.css' continue reading to find all about it..
